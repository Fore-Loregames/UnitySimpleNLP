# UnitySimpleNLP
A simple algorithm for making naturally speaking NPCs

This uses intents in a JSON file to create a form of NPL. You can have different types of intents of understanding emotion as well to make it seem more realistic in answering. It's just a toy I made in pure C# to create a desktop assistant and figured I would share the code. Don't look for comments since there are not any.

If you want to break the code out from Unity you can. it is not bound to unity. All code is from scratch.

Note: make sure to add your JSON file to a resources folder.
